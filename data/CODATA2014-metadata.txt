  This report gives the 2014 self-consistent set of values of the constants and
conversion factors of physics and chemistry recommended by the Committee on
Data for Science and Technology (CODATA). These values are based on a
least-squares adjustment that takes into account all data available up to 31
December 2014. The recommended values may also be found on the World Wide Web
at physics.nist.gov/constants.
