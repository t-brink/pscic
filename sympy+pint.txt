* multiplication works!

* addition fails for symbols, if both sides do not have the same
  dimension; problem is, that the unit is implicit in the x:

  1cm - x = 0   =>   x is obviously 1cm

* exponents fail for symbolic: (1cm)^x raises an exception.
  everything else works. This is a corner case, but would be nice to
  have

* matrix/solve: sympy wants to convert to a sympy object, which fails.
  we need to turn the unit into a symbol-like sympy-object

** This object will let sympy handle the magnitude part and pint the
   unit part and will raise an exception if the unit is incompatible

** The magnitude should not be part of this Unit object, this will
   simplify a lot of things.  Started implementing in psciclib.unitbridge.

** This object may be the solution to all the above problems.
