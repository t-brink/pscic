In order:

* support functions
** bunch of letters followed by open paranthesis
** may be implemented as a special kind of opening paranthesis

* support constants (a bunch of letters instead of numbers)
** e, pi, physical constants, ...

* support variables (x,y,z only perhaps?)
** calculate everything except them
** really useful when introducing the = sign, to solve a Dreisatz etc.

* support units
** this is the meat of the matter
** may be hard to parse

* support unit conversion ("to" keyword like qalculate)

* support plots

* GUI

* other fancy stuff?
